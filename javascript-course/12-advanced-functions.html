      greeting();
      //One way of writing function
      function greeting() {
        console.log('Hello');
      }

      greeting();

      //Another way of writing functions
      //Functions are values, just like other types we can assign functions to a variable
      const function1 = function greeting(){
        console.log("World");
      }; //Since we are assigning a function to varible we need to add semicolon at the end

      console.log(function1);
      console.log(typeof function1);

      function1();

      //As we can see we write two functions in two ways
      //The advantage of writing function shown in first is 
      //1) Easier to read
      //2) Hoisting - we can call the function in above lines (See greeting function defined above in line 9)

      //We can still improve second way of writing function by removing greeting
      //This is called anonymous function
